# First output shows the first 8 rows of the dataset.
# 
# Second output shows the number of columns and rows as a tuple of (rows, columns). In this dataset, there are 18 columns and 989 rows.
# 
# Third output is a list of the columns' names: 'year', 'category', 'prize', 'motivation', 'price_share', 'laureate_id','laureate_type', 'full_name', 'birth_date', 'birth_city', 'birth_country', 'gender', 'organization_name', 'organization_city', 'organization_country', 'death_date', 'death_city', 'death_country'.

#2. Looking at all winners in this data, which gender and which country is the most commonly represented?

genderCount = nobel['gender'].value_counts()

# First output shows the most commonly represented gender of the winners in the data, which is male, and the number of winners of that gender - 898. 
# 
# Second output shows the most commonly represented country of the winners in the data, which is USA, and the number of winners from that country - 296.

# In[16]:


#3. Calculate the proportions of winners from that country in each decade. Make some plots to visualize your results.

# First output shows the proportions of winners from USA in each decade (i.e., number of USA winners out of the total number of winners in each decade).
# 
# Second output shows the same data in bar chart form. Upon visualizing my results, it's clearer that the proportion of winners from USA reached the highest in the 2000s, at 0.439024.

#4. Is there any gender imbalance in this data? How significant is that? Calculate the proportion of female laureates in each decade. Visualize your results and discuss.

# First output shows the proportion of female laureates in the data. A little over 6% of the individual laureates are female, showing that there is great gender imbalance in the data.
# 
# Second output shows the proportion of female laureates in each decade.
# 
# Third output visualizes the same data. The proportion of female laureates reached the lowest in the 1950s at 0 and the highest in the 2020s at 0.194444. The general upwards trend of the proportion of female laureates starting from the 1970s could potentially be explained by the rise in gender equality and more opportunities granted to potential female laureates.

# #13 Explanation: To count the number of cases for each month, data needs to first be grouped by "Month" to organize the data by month, then count the occurrences of corresponding month within the data for number of cases. to_dict() is used at the end to transform the resulting data type Series into Dictionary. The largest number of cases is 3392. max() is used to find the maximum number, and .values(0 is to refer to values within the dictionary instead of keys.

# #14 Explanation: values for x and y are taken from the dictionary created in #13. For x, .keys() is used to return the month (key) from the dictionary, while values() is used to return number of cases each month (value) from it. Line chart and bar chart are plotted to visualize the growth and decline of cases.

# #17 Explanation: New data series are first to summarize number of cases each month in each region. Values are returned from the series during plotting. Line plot and bar graphs are used to visualize the difference among number of cases each month from each region.

# #17 Analysis: In the beginning, Vancouver Coastal has the steepest increase in cases from February to March. However, number of cases in Fraser started to surpass from mid-March, while cases in Vancouver Coastal declined. After mid-March, Fraser remained as the region with the largest number of cases, and Vancouver Coastal has the second largest.

region['Cumulative Cases'] = region.groupby(['HA'])['Number of Cases'].cumsum()
region=region.drop(['Number of Cases'], axis=1)
region.head(8)


# #18-1 Explanation: A new data frame "region" is created to return number of cases each month in each region for easiness to do cumulative aggregation. A new column "Cumulative Cases" is created to indicate the number of cases from that the region has accumulated until that month, thus the use of group by 'HA' then cumsum.

# #18-2 Explanation: By using the data series created in #17 for number of cases in each region each month, cumsum() is applied to the series to result in number of cumulative cases in every month for each region. Line plot is used to visualize the differences of cumulative cases.

# #18-2 Analysis: Vancouver Coastal had the all-time largest number of cumulative cases in February and March, and Fraser had it from April and onwards.

# Based on previous graphs, we can tell that the number of cases through out all regions rapidly grew since July and onwards. It may be assumed that cases rose in summer as people went outside more for activities and gatherings, especially when children and students were on school vacations. 

# Also, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal regions had similar slopes for number of increasing cases. However, Fraser had far more cases than Vancouver Coastal, which could be resulted from Fraser's larger population.

# An additional graph is made in this question to further investigate and visualize the total number of  cases in each age group. It is evident that age groups of 20-29 had the highest number of cases, while 30-39 had the second highest and 40-49 being the third.

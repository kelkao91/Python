## Python
Course group projects for Python based on the same data set. 
Below are some highlights from the project.

### 1. Data Analysis & Visualization

### 2. Machine Learning (Group Project)
**Introduction:** Our team has chosen to analyze the BC Car Crashes data set. We found that the column names were descriptors of the recorded crashes in the dataset and realized that from another perspective, some of them could be interpreted as a factor in the crashes. We then started to wonder which of these had the greatest impact on the severity of car crashes. 

**Research Question:** Which car crash factor has the most impact on crash severity and what is the effect?


**Converted categorical values into binary variables with 1/0 or dummy variables.**
